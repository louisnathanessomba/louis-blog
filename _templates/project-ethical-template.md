# Introduction
Briefly restate the project and explain why ethical and ecological reflections are essential.  
Set the stage: technology is never neutral — it must respect humans and the environment.

---

# Human-Centered Considerations
- How does this project empower people?  
- Does it reduce dependency on centralized elites?  
- Does it improve accessibility, equity, or inclusion?  
- What risks to human autonomy or privacy must be addressed?

---

# Ecological Responsibility
- Energy consumption and efficiency (local vs cloud).  
- Hardware sustainability (e.g., Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors).  
- Waste reduction and lifecycle management.  
- Environmental footprint compared to traditional solutions.

---

# Interdependence of Ethics & Ecology
Explain how ethical and ecological concerns reinforce each other:  
- Example: Local AI reduces cloud dependency **and** energy use.  
- Example: Offline-first SaaS empowers underserved regions **and** avoids wasteful infrastructure.

---

# Long-Term Sustainability
- How can this project remain viable over time?  
- What improvements could make it more sustainable?  
- How does it align with global goals (e.g., digital equity, ecological balance)?

---

# Reflection
Your personal perspective:  
- Why ethics and ecology are inseparable in your work.  
- How this project embodies your philosophy of responsible innovation.
