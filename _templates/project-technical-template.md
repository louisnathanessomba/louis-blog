# Introduction
Briefly restate the project and explain why technical details matter.  
Set the stage for the reader: what they will learn in this post.

---

# System Architecture
Describe the overall architecture:  
- Hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, sensors, mobile devices)  
- Software stack (languages, frameworks, libraries)  
- Data flow (input, processing, output)  
- Diagram (optional: include an image in `/assets/images/`)

---

# Core Components
Break down the main modules:  
- **Frontend** (UI/UX, HTML/CSS/JS)  
- **Backend** (PHP, Python, SQL, APIs)  
- **Data Layer** (databases, storage, offline-first mechanisms)  
- **AI/Logic** (conditional structures, iterative loops, ML models)

---

# Implementation Details
Provide specifics:  
- Algorithms used (statistics, probability, ML techniques)  
- Code snippets (highlight key functions or structures)  
- Integration challenges and solutions  
- Performance considerations (speed, memory, energy use)

---

# Testing & Validation
Explain how you tested the system:  
- Unit tests  
- Simulations or prototypes  
- Real-world trials with classmates or partners  
- Metrics (accuracy, efficiency, sustainability)
