# Exploring Frontiers — Research & Comparative Analysis

This division explores the scientific and philosophical frontiers that enrich the **Firmware AI thesis**.  
It is divided into two subsections: **Independently Search** (deep dives into core disciplines) and **Companies Threads** (comparisons of major tech visions).

## 🔬 Independently Search

Here I share independent research across five domains, each with its own sub-section:

- [Mathematics](/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/mathematics/)  
- [Physics](/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/physics/)  
- [Chemistry](/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/chemistry/)  
- [Computer Science](/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/computer-science/)  
- [Philosophy](/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/philosophy/)

Each sub-section contains posts documenting concepts I study independently, from advanced theories to applied insights.

## 🏢 Companies Threads

Here I analyze and compare the visions of major technology companies in domains such as AI, Big Data, and cloud computing:

- [Microsoft vs Google](/Exploring-Frontiers/Companies-Threads/microsoft-vs-google/)  
- [Tesla AI Strategy](/Exploring-Frontiers/Companies-Threads/tesla-ai-strategy/)  
- [Cloud Computing Comparison](/Exploring-Frontiers/Companies-Threads/cloud-computing-comparison/)

These threads highlight differences in philosophy, architecture, and ethical implications, connecting back to the Firmware AI paradigm.
