# About Me — Louis Olinga

I am a young scientist-technologist, currently in the scientific department of Première, with strong foundations in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science.  
Beyond school programs, I pursue advanced research independently, building projects that serve as proofs of concept for my **Firmware AI thesis**.

## 🌌 Vision

My long-term mission is to democratize access to algorithms and reduce dependence on centralized elites.  
Through **Firmware AI**, I envision devices with local intelligence, borrowing models from the cloud as a library of algorithms, always guided by ethics and ecology.
